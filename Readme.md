# MATH582: Nonlinear Programming (KFUPM – Term 251)

This repository contains course materials, code, and notes for **MATH582 – Nonlinear Programming**, taught by [Dr. Mohammed Alshahrani](https://mshahrani.website/) at King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.

## 📚 Course Description

An advanced introduction to the theory and algorithms of nonlinear programming, with an emphasis on convex programs. Topics include:

- Convex sets, convex functions, and their generalizations
- First and second-order optimality conditions
- Constraint qualifications
- Lagrangian convexity and duality
- Penalty function methods
- Algorithms for unconstrained and constrained optimization
- Applications in economics, operations research, and mathematics

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Derive and apply necessary and sufficient optimality conditions
- Analyze constraint qualifications and formulate dual problems
- Discuss and implement major algorithms for nonlinear programs
- Solve problems using penalty functions and duality concepts
